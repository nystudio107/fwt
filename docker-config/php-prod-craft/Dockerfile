# Force permissions, update Craft, and start php-fpm

# Do a `composer install` without running any Composer scripts
# - If `composer.lock` is present, it will install what is in the lock file
# - If `composer.lock` is missing, it will update to the latest dependencies
#   and create the `composer.lock` file
# This automatic running adds to the startup overhead of `docker-compose up`
# but saves far more time in not having to deal with out of sync versions
# when working with teams or multiple environments
